data/segments/m03/m03-110/m03-110-s02-01.png|to entertain for an instant the idea , the

data/segments/m03/m03-110/m03-110-s02-03.png|inconceivable idea , that Ariadne's arrival
data/segments/m03/m03-110/m03-110-s02-04.png|would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
data/segments/m03/m03-110/m03-110-s02-05.png|a somewhat vulgar impulse , which I refused ,
data/segments/m03/m03-110/m03-110-s02-06.png|to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs

data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s00-00.png|But all three were to the casual
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s00-01.png|observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s00-02.png|Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s00-03.png|thoughtful , but that was his habit .
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s01-00.png|Indeed
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s01-01.png|we were all invaded by a most tranquil

data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-00.png|Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-01.png|so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-02.png|savage tribes never approached this region : at
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-03.png|any rate they remained with us , perhaps
data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-04.png|for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s00-00.png|But after what Mrs Caine had said it was never
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s00-01.png|far from our minds that at any moment we were
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s00-02.png|to receive a summons .
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s01-00.png|I could see that Mr Septimus
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s01-01.png|was impatient for it .
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s02-00.png|This afternoon , then , we climbed
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s02-01.png|a promontory , a mass of clean rock crowned with
data/segments/m03/m03-118/m03-118-s02-02.png|trees and bushes , that stood well out over the lake .

data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-01.png|could not help wondering whether , now she
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-02.png|had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-03.png|little Dai was quite the man for her .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s02-00.png|A nice boy of course .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-00.png|But perhaps in the
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-01.png|new world she was entering there might
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-02.png|be boys equally nice , and with far more
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-03.png|to offer .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s04-00.png|The conductor rang his bell .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s00-00.png|" Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s01-00.png|" Good-bye , Morfydd . "
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s02-00.png|He sought to enfold her in his arms .

data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s04-00.png|She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s05-00.png|And Morfydd Owen
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s05-01.png|waving , unkissed , from the window .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s06-00.png|And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s06-01.png|heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s00-00.png|So the bus set out for Llangrwl .
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s01-00.png|But it never reached there !
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s02-00.png|Somewhere ,
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s02-01.png|on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly

data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s03-00.png|The first intimation that all was not well came when a

data/segments/m04/m04-200/m04-200-s06-00.png|That was their

data/segments/m04/m04-238/m04-238-s02-01.png|said the Rev. Edwards .

data/segments/m06/m06-098/m06-098-s06-03.png|everlasting night .
data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s00-00.png|Motion there was , but motion without event - except

data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s02-01.png|that they learned to fly properly .

data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s03-01.png|with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s03-02.png|new flesh and tendon strengthened .
data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s04-00.png|To sail up in the
data/segments/m06/m06-106/m06-106-s04-01.png|light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly

data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s00-00.png|Alastair was a bachelor .
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s01-00.png|All his life he had
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s01-01.png|been inclined to regard women as something
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s01-02.png|which must necessarily be subordinated to his
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s01-03.png|career .
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s02-00.png|Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s02-01.png|his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s02-02.png|whom he had never met and on whom after no more
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s02-03.png|than a couple of telephone calls he was
data/segments/n01/n01-000/n01-000-s02-04.png|prepared to place complete reliance .
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s00-00.png|It was a novel experience .
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s01-00.png|Alastair was
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s01-01.png|quite unable to explain why he should feel
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s01-02.png|so much confidence in her .
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s02-00.png|Once again
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s02-01.png|she checked back her instructions .
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s03-00.png|It was
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s03-01.png|obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s03-02.png|faith which he was placing in her and
data/segments/n01/n01-004/n01-004-s03-03.png|was prepared to accept the responsibility .
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s00-00.png|" Good luck , Air Marshal , " she said gently .
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s01-00.png|" I 'll
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s01-01.png|be waiting for you at the Hotel Roma at six this

data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s02-00.png|They might have been

data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s03-00.png|Then she rang off .
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s04-00.png|Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s04-01.png|uneventful life had he come across a girl who
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s04-02.png|sounded so charming and appeared to be so
data/segments/n01/n01-009/n01-009-s04-03.png|efficient .
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s00-00.png|For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s00-01.png|to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s00-02.png|physical features were distinguishable solely by
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s00-03.png|gradations of silvery greyness .
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s01-00.png|Even the snow-
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s01-01.png|capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s01-02.png|below , was not recognisable among the host
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s01-03.png|of lower peaks .
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s02-00.png|The screen of the air-to-air
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s02-01.png|radar glowed .
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s03-00.png|Occasionally minute spots
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s03-01.png|flickered across its surface , but there was
data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s03-02.png|no permanent image .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-00.png|In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-01.png|make a direct comparison between the radar
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-02.png|image and the ground itself .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-00.png|Ahead lay the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-01.png|Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-02.png|left , Milan .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-00.png|The directional angle of the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-01.png|scanner could be adjusted to cover any
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-02.png|particular area within its range .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-00.png|Geoffrey
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-01.png|turned the scale slowly to cover the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-02.png|ground immediately ahead .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-00.png|He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-01.png|naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-02.png|on the clearest night limited angular vision .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s01-00.png|He glanced
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s01-01.png|at the speed recorder .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-00.png|It seemed almost incredible that
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-01.png|the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-02.png|was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-00.png|Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-01.png|pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-02.png|dipped slightly .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-00.png|The needle of the speed
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-01.png|recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-02.png|before coming to rest at 5.0 .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s02-00.png|" We 're a bit
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s02-01.png|ahead of time , " said Alastair .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s03-00.png|" We 'll run
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s03-01.png|in on minimum engine power . "
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s04-00.png|Geoffrey
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s04-01.png|smiled .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-00.png|Alastair talked of running in when
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-01.png|they were still more than four hundred
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-02.png|miles from their destination .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s00-00.png|They were nearing Modena .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s01-00.png|Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s01-01.png|on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-00.png|He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-01.png|thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-02.png|along which he had motored so desperately little
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-03.png|more than twenty-four hours earlier .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-00.png|Since then
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-01.png|he had flown to England , attended the vital
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-02.png|conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-03.png|by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-04.png|Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-05.png|refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-06.png|of the journey back to the place where every
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-07.png|indication pointed to Eve being held .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s00-00.png|Geoffrey set himself to consider the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s00-01.png|movements of the Bentley .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-00.png|It had passed
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-01.png|him at the temporary bridge over the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-02.png|Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-03.png|previous night .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-00.png|He worked out the distance
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-01.png|on the presumption that its route had been
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-02.png|through Florence and Rome and then
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-03.png|across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s03-00.png|It came to just over six hundred
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s03-01.png|miles .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s00-00.png|DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s00-01.png|time they docked at Belleray .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-00.png|And though Guy ,
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-01.png|made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-02.png|speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-03.png|the party was over .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-00.png|Piers came strolling out to
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-01.png|meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-02.png|driven away , invited them casually to come to
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-03.png|his flat for a drink .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s00-00.png|To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s00-01.png|vengeance .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s01-00.png|She had expected to be met with violent
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s01-01.png|reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s02-00.png|But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s02-01.png|was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-00.png|He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-01.png|own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-02.png|asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-03.png|to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s00-00.png|" I caught him just as he was going to the
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s00-01.png|airport to meet Blanche , " he said .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-00.png|" As a matter
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-01.png|of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-02.png|for me and fetch her .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s02-00.png|He brought her to the party
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s02-01.png|too .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s03-00.png|They 're both here . "
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s04-00.png|" I didn't know she was
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s04-01.png|coming back from Barbados so soon . "
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s05-00.png|Beryl
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s05-01.png|said the first thing that came into her head .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s00-00.png|" Oh , she was due ! "
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s01-00.png|And then he added in the same
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s01-01.png|casual tone ,
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s02-00.png|" She 's not returning to her family .

data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s03-02.png|this side of Belleray . "
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s04-00.png|Mrs. Deane made a suitable
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s04-01.png|comment , but Beryl said nothing .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s05-00.png|She was trying
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s05-01.png|to sort things out in her mind .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-00.png|That beneath his
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-01.png|unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-02.png|with anger against her she had no doubt .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-00.png|Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-01.png|express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-02.png|of his guests .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-00.png|But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-01.png|suggested having a second party , the following week , he
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-02.png|poured cold water on the project .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-00.png|Everyone , he declared ,
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-01.png|had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-02.png|nearly to next week to settle down again .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-00.png|Meanwhile
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-01.png|Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-02.png|earned gratuity to his native village at the
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-03.png|north of the island .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s00-00.png|It was all over and done with .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-00.png|For the time being Beryl was content to let
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-01.png|it go at that , but she resolved to have
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-02.png|it out with Piers when a reasonable
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-03.png|opportunity presented itself .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-00.png|He must
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-01.png|learn that he could not treat her
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-02.png|with injustice and contempt , ignoring
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-03.png|her explanations as though he were
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-04.png|a schoolmaster and she a small ,
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-05.png|ignorant child .
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-00.png|He gave her no chance of any private
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-01.png|conversation that evening , for when
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-02.png|Blanche and Jack left , he went with
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-03.png|them .
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-00.png|But next morning she insisted
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-01.png|on his taking her out in the jeep -
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-02.png|to find , if possible , Hubert and his
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-03.png|relations , and tell them of
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-04.png|her great disappointment at being
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-05.png|held up in Balicou .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-00.png|With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-01.png|Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-02.png|beside him .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s01-00.png|" Is that all you want to do ? "
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s01-01.png|he asked , letting in the clutch .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-00.png|" No ; I want
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-01.png|to make you understand just what happened
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-02.png|about this Balicou trip , " she returned
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-03.png|coldly .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s03-00.png|" I 'm a little tired of being treated
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s03-01.png|like an ineffective imbecile . "
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s00-00.png|" And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s00-01.png|to account for my manners , " he retorted .
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s01-00.png|" What have I done wrong now ?
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-00.png|I cover up for
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-01.png|you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-02.png|to make the presentation , I run the damned
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-03.png|party to the best of my ability - saying the
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-04.png|sugary things you ought to have been there
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-05.png|to say - and all you can do is to find
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-06.png|fault . "
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s00-00.png|" It 's your superior attitude that riles me . "
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s01-00.png|Beryl was
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s01-01.png|scarlet with annoyance .

data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s02-01.png|at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree .

data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-01.png|look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-02.png|as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-03.png|and his pals down . "
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s00-00.png|" As your employee it 's not my business

data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s00-03.png|stiffly .

data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s02-00.png|" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s03-00.png|Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s03-01.png|mounting exasperation .
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s04-00.png|" Very well ! "
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s05-00.png|He
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s05-01.png|brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s05-02.png|path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s06-00.png|" If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s00-00.png|You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .

data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s02-00.png|But you didn't press
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s02-01.png|the matter because , very naturally , you were
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s02-02.png|thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s02-03.png|idyllic surroundings . "
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s03-00.png|" How dare you say
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s03-01.png|such a thing ? " she blazed .
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s04-00.png|" For goodness'

data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s04-02.png|equally indignant rejoinder .
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s00-00.png|" You talk as though we were alone on Balicou ! "
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s01-00.png|She avoided his gaze , and tried to ignore that
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s01-01.png|last impertinent remark .
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s02-00.png|" With four other people - "
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s03-00.png|" Whom you never once managed to circumvent . "
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s04-00.png|The mockery in his voice had deepened .
data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s05-00.png|" With

data/segments/n02/n02-082a/n02-082a-s06-00.png|She met his eyes then .
data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s00-00.png|She wavered , and at last said
data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s00-01.png|slowly ,
data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s01-00.png|" If you must drag the truth

data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s03-00.png|He was clearly startled by her

data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s04-00.png|" But remember , it was you ,
data/segments/n02/n02-098/n02-098-s04-01.png|not I , who started this conversation . "
data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s00-00.png|" I know .
data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s01-00.png|Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want

data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s02-00.png|She turned away
data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s02-01.png|from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s02-02.png|amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s02-03.png|gain her attention .

data/segments/n02/n02-104/n02-104-s03-03.png|have had it in for Guy .
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s00-00.png|You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s00-01.png|on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s00-02.png|flamingoes our first morning on the island . "
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s01-00.png|" What harm could possibly have come to Forrest

data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s02-00.png|Piers could
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s02-01.png|hardly have spoken with more contempt .
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s03-00.png|A bully like that respects anyone who
data/segments/n02/n02-109/n02-109-s03-01.png|dares to stand up to him . "
data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s00-00.png|Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s00-01.png|precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s01-00.png|She said icily ,
data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s02-00.png|" As you pride yourself on

data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s02-03.png|Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
data/segments/n02/n02-114/n02-114-s02-04.png|important customers . "

data/segments/n02/n02-120/n02-120-s05-01.png|pretty spineless ! "

data/segments/n02/n02-127/n02-127-s03-00.png|He had to smile
data/segments/n02/n02-127/n02-127-s03-01.png|at that , but went on airily ,

data/segments/n02/n02-146/n02-146-s00-00.png|She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck

data/segments/n02/n02-146/n02-146-s03-00.png|To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
data/segments/n02/n02-146/n02-146-s03-01.png|where Hubert had been living to find the old man stowing in

data/segments/n02/n02-146/n02-146-s03-03.png|incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives .
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-00.png|Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-01.png|to have been guests at yesterday's
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-02.png|celebrations , and their friendly welcome
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-03.png|and warm sympathy , as she explained
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-04.png|how she had come to miss the party ,
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-05.png|made her send a complacent glance
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s00-06.png|in Piers' direction .
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s01-00.png|What a fuss-box the
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s01-01.png|man was , she thought impatiently ,
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s01-02.png|trying to worry her into the belief
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s01-03.png|that her failure to appear at a function
data/segments/n02/n02-151/n02-151-s01-04.png|on the estate was a major error :
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s00-00.png|And then she received a jolt .
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s01-00.png|Old Hubert , standing
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s01-01.png|beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s01-02.png|toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s01-03.png|in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had
data/segments/n02/n02-154/n02-154-s01-04.png|explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl "

data/segments/n04/n04-156/n04-156-s02-00.png|Bawley was a man of his word .

data/segments/n04/n04-171/n04-171-s06-00.png|" Better ask Robbie Munyard . "

data/segments/n04/n04-183/n04-183-s02-00.png|" What is there to write up ? " said

data/segments/n04/n04-183/n04-183-s03-00.png|" There are forty-three submarines in

data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s00-00.png|" I don't want it to happen again , " said Bawley -
data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s00-01.png|" more so than ever since I met you . "
data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s01-00.png|" What did Munyard say ? "
data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s02-00.png|" The Snort - hull

data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s03-02.png|and X-rayed and that it was as sound as a bell ? "
data/segments/n04/n04-190/n04-190-s03-03.png|said John .
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s00-00.png|" Munyard didn't tell me that .

data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s01-01.png|I 'm relieved .
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s02-00.png|But it still doesn't do away
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s02-01.png|with the possibility of faulty design . "
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s03-00.png|He held
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s03-01.png|out his hand .

data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s04-01.png|one of these days , " he said .
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s05-00.png|" In the meantime
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s05-01.png|I 'll tell my editor that the story 's a dead bird .

data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s03-00.png|" I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s03-01.png|Master bloody Munyard . "
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s04-00.png|THERE were six submarines ,
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s04-01.png|lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-00.png|Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-01.png|sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-02.png|charged their electric batteries .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s00-00.png|A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s00-01.png|through the open windows of the Captain's house .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-00.png|It
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-01.png|pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-02.png|Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-03.png|a substantial breakfast .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-00.png|Although usually a very
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-01.png|talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-02.png|silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-03.png|some sort .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s00-00.png|There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s00-01.png|affair of Parsifal .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s01-00.png|Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s02-00.png|His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s02-01.png|but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-00.png|It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-01.png|to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-02.png|though in peace time these happenings are few and
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-03.png|far between .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s00-00.png|This is the testing time for all .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-00.png|The affair blows up into
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-01.png|a national disaster and then when it is all over life
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-02.png|must continue as before .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-00.png|During this period the Captain
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-01.png|must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-02.png|if nothing unusual has happened .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-00.png|Harry Turton had
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-01.png|written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-02.png|locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-03.png|his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-04.png|usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-05.png|suitable for such occasions .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s00-00.png|He rode down to where I was waiting .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s01-00.png|I was
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s01-01.png|thinking what a skill he had for reading

data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s02-00.png|" This would be as good a place
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s02-01.png|for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in

data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s03-00.png|" Yes , " I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s04-00.png|" It 'll be here to-

data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s05-00.png|I paused .

data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s08-00.png|But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at

data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s00-00.png|" Maybe , " I said .

data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s03-00.png|" Of course , " he said ,
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s03-01.png|giving me one of his strange looks .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s04-00.png|Then he
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s04-01.png|turned the conversation .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s05-00.png|" Let 's ride over
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s05-01.png|and have a look at the mining camp .

data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s00-00.png|With something of a start I remembered the

data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s02-00.png|" Know what ? "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s03-00.png|" That he 's dead , "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s03-01.png|I said .

data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s05-00.png|" Dead ? " he said .

data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s04-01.png|his horse back off the trail and up the slope
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s04-02.png|leading to the ridge .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s05-00.png|I followed .

data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s06-01.png|top you could see something of the wild hill
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s06-02.png|country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-00.png|The air was fresh and clear and you
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-01.png|could see far over west and north for many
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-02.png|miles .
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s01-00.png|The real high country of the Rockies
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s01-01.png|lifted up in the distance like a pale water-

data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-00.png|Between us and that lay
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-01.png|a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-02.png|malpais .
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s00-00.png|" The mine-workings lie north of the town , "
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s00-01.png|said Dan .

data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-00.png|So we swung west , making slow going over
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-01.png|rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-02.png|into draws , circling a big mesa by a
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-03.png|four or five mile valley , sandy-floored .

data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-01.png|got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-02.png|gratefully by a small creek where we watered
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-03.png|the horses and drank enough to cure our

data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s00-00.png|An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s00-01.png|we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-00.png|We turned north into it and after about four
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-01.png|miles it led into a small canyon which
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-02.png|opened out into a wide shallow draw .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s02-00.png|Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s02-01.png|the miners at work .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-00.png|They were scattered
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-01.png|over a fairly wide area working singly or
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-02.png|in pairs .
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s00-00.png|We didn't approach unchallenged .

data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-01.png|of the diggings there was a roughly-built
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-02.png|shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-03.png|out ,

data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s00-00.png|" Oh , " said the unseen guard .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s01-00.png|He blew a
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s01-01.png|whistle then , loud and shrill .

data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s02-01.png|peeking out through a hole in the shack never

data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s05-02.png|observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle .

data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s06-01.png|was never long on patience .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s00-00.png|I saw several men running down towards
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s00-01.png|the shack .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s01-00.png|They were all armed with rifles .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s02-00.png|As the nearest of them came round the

data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s03-00.png|He
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s03-01.png|came up close , eyeing us suspiciously .

data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s01-00.png|We dismounted and

data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s01-02.png|Nick Dowd took our horses off to water .
data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s02-00.png|We followed Nick Dowd into the shack .
data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s03-00.png|They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s03-01.png|a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed .
data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s04-00.png|Other
data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s04-01.png|miners followed in at our heels .

data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s05-01.png|found us a couple of boxes to sit on .

data/segments/n06/n06-163/n06-163-s00-01.png|Derby hat fussed around the stove .

data/segments/n06/n06-163/n06-163-s02-00.png|He introduced the men

data/segments/n06/n06-163/n06-163-s04-01.png|had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
data/segments/n06/n06-163/n06-163-s04-02.png|sweetened with molasses for all and for us
data/segments/n06/n06-163/n06-163-s04-03.png|there were two plates of beans .
data/segments/n06/n06-169/n06-169-s00-00.png|" They gives you the wind , " said the Sodbuster
data/segments/n06/n06-169/n06-169-s00-01.png|handing them to us , " but it 's all we got
data/segments/n06/n06-169/n06-169-s00-02.png|as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold

data/segments/n06/n06-169/n06-169-s01-00.png|He winked at his partners .

data/segments/n06/n06-175/n06-175-s03-00.png|I paused and watched my

data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s00-01.png|you could see they were hard hit .
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-00.png|They were
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-01.png|simple men who knew a lot maybe about
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-02.png|digging for gold but were babes in arms
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-03.png|when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-04.png|desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-05.png|rest .

data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-01.png|a man was drowning and towards his last
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-02.png|gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-03.png|life came up before him in some cinematic
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-04.png|kind of sequence .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s00-00.png|Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s00-01.png|outbuilding , but this was happening to him now .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-00.png|He
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-01.png|saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-02.png|boy , then a young youth .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s02-00.png|He saw himself refusing
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s02-01.png|baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s03-00.png|Walking out of the chapel later on .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-00.png|Continuing
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-01.png|on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-02.png|canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-03.png|dly decadence and absorption in debase-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-04.png|ment and Satanic debauchery .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s00-00.png|He didn't know what to make of it , but it
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s00-01.png|was Mr. Copthorne all right .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-00.png|Perhaps he had
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-01.png|been attending some kind of fancy dress do
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-02.png|in London .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s02-00.png|Very strange his eyes looked .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-00.png|Mad ,
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-01.png|hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-02.png|his head , so the verger described afterwards .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s04-00.png|" You 're very early about , sir , " he said , trying to
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s04-01.png|speak normally .
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s00-00.png|" Yes .
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-00.png|I travelled down from London
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-01.png|as the dawn was breaking , and
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-02.png|the thought came to me I 'd like
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-03.png|to take a look at the church .
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s02-00.png|I 've

data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s03-00.png|Very remiss of
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s03-01.png|me , " said Mr. Copthorne .
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s04-00.png|The verger
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s04-01.png|led the way in .
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s05-00.png|" The stained glass
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s05-01.png|windows , sir , they date back to
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s05-02.png|the fourteenth century . "
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s00-00.png|There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s00-01.png|quickly through the customs .
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s01-00.png|" Gay ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s02-00.png|" Gavin ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s03-00.png|The girl
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s03-01.png|and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s03-02.png|together .
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s04-00.png|The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s04-01.png|taxi .
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s05-00.png|" Just a moment , darling , " Gavin pressed her
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s05-01.png|hand and smiled .
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s06-00.png|" I want to check up on the
data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s06-01.png|flights back . "
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s00-00.png|Gay went out to the waiting
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s00-01.png|taxi , and then found that in
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s00-02.png|the excitement of meeting
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s00-03.png|Gavin she had left her sun-
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s00-04.png|glasses on the veranda .
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s01-00.png|She
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s01-01.png|went quickly back to fetch them .
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s02-00.png|Gavin and the girl who had got
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s02-01.png|off the plane with him were talking .
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s03-00.png|He was writing something in his
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s03-01.png|pocket-book , with a sick feeling
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s03-02.png|of despair Gay knew that of course
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-00.png|Gay , sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-01.png|hardly believe that she was the same girl ,
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-02.png|miserable , shy , who had sat at the little
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-03.png|table for the first time a few days ago .
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s01-00.png|Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s01-01.png|and Gay's heart turned over .
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s02-00.png|" I 'd like
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s02-01.png|to do that . "
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s03-00.png|Gavin drained his glass
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s03-01.png|and refilled it .
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s00-00.png|" And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s00-01.png|beach .
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s01-00.png|A moon like this mustn't be wasted . "
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s02-00.png|He gestured towards the bay where the full
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s02-01.png|moon was just rising over the rocks , then
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s02-02.png|laid his hand on hers .
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-00.png|Gay smiled at him
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-01.png|again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-02.png|now Gavin was in love with her and her
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-03.png|only , yet remembering for a second the
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-04.png|kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s00-00.png|All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s01-00.png|She
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s01-01.png|would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s01-02.png|look the other way if need be .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s02-00.png|" I say ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s03-00.png|Gavin was looking over her
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s03-01.png|shoulder .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s04-00.png|" That 's a pretty girl ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s05-00.png|Gay glanced behind her ,
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s06-00.png|" Isn't she
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s06-01.png|lovely , she 's French , a very well known model I believe .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s00-00.png|Gay , a little puzzled , went through
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s00-01.png|to the bar .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s01-00.png|Doc and Lilyan were
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s01-01.png|sitting just inside having coffee .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s02-00.png|" Come and join us and bring your
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s02-01.png|boy friend , " Doc called .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s03-00.png|" No , Doc ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s03-01.png|Lilyan remonstrated .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s04-00.png|" They want to be
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s04-01.png|alone . "
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s05-00.png|" I 've booked a table at the
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s05-01.png|cafe*?2 , " Doc said , " they are packed
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s05-02.png|tonight so come and join us if you
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s05-03.png|can't find a table for two . "
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-00.png|Gay thanked him and walked out on to
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-01.png|the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-02.png|had bought a drink and taken it outside .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-00.png|She looked round scanning the tables ,
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-01.png|then caught her breath , a cold hand
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-02.png|seeming to clutch her heart .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-00.png|Gavin was
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-01.png|seated at a small table in a shadowy
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-02.png|corner talking animatedly to Simone .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-00.png|As Gay watched he offered the girl a
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-01.png|cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-02.png|hers in an intimate way .
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-00.png|Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-01.png|decided to go back and join Lilyan and
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-02.png|Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-03.png|run upstairs to her room , knowing that
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-04.png|Gavin although he had told her that he
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-05.png|loved her , was already flirting with a girl
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-06.png|that he had only met a few minutes before .
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-00.png|Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-01.png|but she turned away , giving a little
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-02.png|gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-00.png|The others were all dancing and
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-01.png|as Gay drew out a chair and sat
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-02.png|down Gavin , without a word , swept
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-03.png|Simone on to the floor .
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-00.png|" It doesn't mean
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-01.png|anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-02.png|trying to understand Gavin's point of
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-03.png|view and remembering the advice
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-04.png|that Larry had given her , while she
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-05.png|felt wretched beyond words .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s00-00.png|His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s00-01.png|taste but it was unkind beyond words .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-00.png|She fumbled
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-01.png|with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-02.png|not wanting to smoke but needing some action
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-03.png|to help her control her feelings .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-00.png|" Come and
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-01.png|dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-02.png|lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-03.png|ging a smile .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-00.png|As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-01.png|and Simone go through the doorway that led
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-02.png|down to the beach .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s01-00.png|Gay closed her eyes for a
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s01-01.png|moment in disgust .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-00.png|She was fully aware that Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-01.png|would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-02.png|and no doubt he would come back soon and
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-03.png|after Simone had left expect her to accept his
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-04.png|kisses on the way back to the hotel .

data/segments/p02/p02-121/p02-121-s03-03.png|whenever he flirts with another woman .
data/segments/p02/p02-121/p02-121-s04-00.png|He will
data/segments/p02/p02-121/p02-121-s04-01.png|you know , always , and you aren't the type
data/segments/p02/p02-121/p02-121-s04-02.png|who is tough enough to change him . "
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s00-00.png|Gay nodded .
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s01-00.png|" I know that you 're right Doc , I think
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s01-01.png|now that I do realise that , and in any case , " she added
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s01-02.png|a little sadly , " if I did change Gavin , he wouldn't
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s01-03.png|be the same , if you know what I mean . "
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s02-00.png|" You sound
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s02-01.png|like Alice in Wonderland , " Doc gently mocked her , " and
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s02-02.png|I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
data/segments/p02/p02-127/p02-127-s02-03.png|your time on that chap .
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s00-00.png|Now let him go and you won't have to wait
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s00-01.png|long for the right man for you to come
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s00-02.png|along .
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s01-00.png|If I was thirty years younger and weren't

data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s02-00.png|Gay laughed , Doc was
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s02-01.png|so kind and nice and she hoped that one
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s02-02.png|day she would be able to see the situation
data/segments/p02/p02-131/p02-131-s02-03.png|as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-00.png|Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-01.png|again Gay found herself alone at the table
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-02.png|feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-03.png|people were talking about the way Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-04.png|was behaving since they had seen them
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-05.png|dining together .
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s01-00.png|She opened her bag
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s01-01.png|to get out her compact and saw Grace's
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s01-02.png|letter .
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s02-00.png|She drew it out and opened it ,
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s02-01.png|glad to be able to occupy herself .
data/segments/p02/p02-139/p02-139-s00-00.png|" So glad that you are having such a lovely time , dearie , "
data/segments/p02/p02-139/p02-139-s00-01.png|it ran .

data/segments/p02/p02-139/p02-139-s03-00.png|He 's getting on well but is pretty helpless still with his

data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s01-00.png|Gay read the rest of the letter then put
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s01-01.png|it back in her bag .
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s02-00.png|Elaine was engaged ,
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s02-01.png|to the man she had spent so much time
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s02-02.png|with at her party .
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s03-00.png|That was why
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s03-01.png|Gavin had come back to her .
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s04-00.png|Everything was quite clear now , and to
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s04-01.png|her own surprise Gay felt no heartbreak ,
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s04-02.png|rather a sense of relief now that she
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s04-03.png|knew why Gavin had come to see
data/segments/p02/p02-144/p02-144-s04-04.png|her .
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s00-00.png|Because she was second best .
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s01-00.png|The others came back
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s01-01.png|to the table , all of them making a fuss of her and at once
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s01-02.png|she felt happier .
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s02-00.png|Gay loved them for their warm sympathy ,
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s02-01.png|knowing that they were real friends , even if they were new ones .
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s03-00.png|" That is a pretty dress , " Lilyan commented , obviously sensing
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s03-01.png|Gay's distress and in a way that Doc , as a man , could not
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s03-02.png|understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s03-03.png|for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
data/segments/p02/p02-150/p02-150-s03-04.png|was hurt for herself .
data/segments/p02/p02-155/p02-155-s00-00.png|" I made it myself , " Gay tried to speak
data/segments/p02/p02-155/p02-155-s00-01.png|normally .

data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s00-03.png|thoughts .
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-00.png|At one time she had

data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-03.png|to put St. John's Casualty Department

data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s02-00.png|She would think of her-

data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s02-02.png|studying these cross-roads .
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s03-00.png|Which

data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-03.png|wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded

data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-00.png|Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-01.png|and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-02.png|a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-03.png|evening ,
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s02-00.png|" If we get married , old girl , you 'll have to stop

data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-01.png|which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-02.png|word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-03.png|with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-04.png|which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-05.png|seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-06.png|been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-07.png|Little Phelpham .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-00.png|Now Nigel had every right to go where he
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-01.png|liked during his off-duty periods
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-02.png|when she was not free ; this much they had
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-03.png|conceded one to the other .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-00.png|They rarely
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-01.png|found they were off duty together , and
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-02.png|the situation would have been intolerable
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-03.png|had there not been some give and take
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-04.png|about their relationship .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-00.png|So when Nigel
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-01.png|had told her about taking Luke's
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-02.png|evening surgery she had said ,
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s00-00.png|" Bless you !
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s01-00.png|I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . "
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s02-00.png|" Oh , well , "
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s02-01.png|he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work .

data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s04-00.png|Nigel was the hospital's

data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s05-02.png|asked hopefully .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s00-00.png|" Hardly likely , my sweet .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s01-00.png|Luke's surgery goes on for

data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s02-00.png|If they get in before eight-thirty , even

data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s04-00.png|O.K. , " she had
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s04-01.png|replied readily .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-00.png|So how could Nigel have
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-01.png|been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-02.png|dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-03.png|very evening ?
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s00-00.png|" No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior

data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s01-00.png|" It was Nigel's car , anyway .

data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s03-00.png|" He probably loaned his car

data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s05-00.png|Young Gubbins shrugged .

data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-01.png|realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-02.png|was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-03.png|made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s01-00.png|" Nigel , " she had besought him , " you know that evening
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s01-01.png|you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman

data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s00-00.png|" 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the

data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s01-00.png|" What about it , my sweet ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s02-00.png|" Well , " she laughed
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s02-01.png|suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid

data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s05-00.png|Nigel was frowning .
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s06-00.png|He
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s06-01.png|looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly

data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-00.png|Though Diana knew the name of every

data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-02.png|Nigel often had to think hard to sort
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-03.png|them out .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s04-00.png|" He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s04-01.png|he now demanded .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s05-00.png|" What was he
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s05-01.png|doing at the Load of Trouble ? "

data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s01-03.png|this blonde . "
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s02-00.png|" Really ? " Nigel cocked

data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s03-00.png|" Actually she was brunette
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s03-01.png|at the roots and I had a redhead on

data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s04-00.png|He would have told

data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s05-00.png|" No , " she laughed .

data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s01-00.png|" Now I wonder which I wore at that
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s01-01.png|particular surgery ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s02-00.png|" You are a fool ,
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s02-01.png|darling , " Di said happily .

data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s04-00.png|" No , don't , " he said , after
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s04-01.png|kissing her again .

data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s03-01.png|was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .

data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s07-00.png|" It would make me more interesting ,
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s07-01.png|I suppose ? " she enquired archly .
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s00-00.png|" No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped ,
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s00-01.png|surprising her .
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s01-00.png|" You sounded like some-

data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s03-00.png|" Nigel - ! " she gasped .
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s04-00.png|" I didn't mean to

data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s07-03.png|trying to be bright and gay about it .
data/segments/p03/p03-121/p03-121-s00-00.png|I 'm going with a shooting party .

data/segments/p03/p03-121/p03-121-s04-00.png|I didn't expect ... "

data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s00-00.png|Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and
data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s00-01.png|he admired her legs , which the male sex were inclined to
data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s00-02.png|regard first .
data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s01-00.png|" I would mind if you didn't " he told her
data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s01-01.png|grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms .

data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s00-00.png|" Darling ! " her voiced caressed him .
data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s01-00.png|" Moments like this
data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s01-01.png|make all the waiting worth while .

data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s03-00.png|" No , " he eyed her strangely .

data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s06-00.png|Again her laughter trilled .

data/segments/p03/p03-142/p03-142-s07-01.png|isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! "
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s00-00.png|" Isn't it ? " he rose and smoothed himself
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s00-01.png|down .
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s01-00.png|" Ask any bridegroom-to-be .

data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s03-00.png|Problem ... ?

data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s04-00.png|" Are we discussing a marriage
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s04-01.png|or a burial ? " she asked , hardly believing
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s04-02.png|he could be serious .
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s05-00.png|" Surely marrying
data/segments/p03/p03-151/p03-151-s05-01.png|me isn't going to be all that bad ?
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s00-00.png|If it is - " she laughed uncertainly - " you can have
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s00-01.png|your ring back . "
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s01-00.png|She loosened the half-hoop of
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s01-01.png|diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s01-02.png|out to him , still playfully .
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s02-00.png|Without a glimmer
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s02-01.png|of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s02-02.png|it , looking moodily beyond her .
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s03-00.png|" Perhaps it 's as
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s03-01.png|well if you don't wear it for a bit , Di , " he
data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s03-02.png|told her .
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s00-00.png|" But I want it ! " she protested .
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s01-00.png|" It 's my ring . "
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s02-00.png|" You just gave it back to me . "

data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s03-01.png|didn't !
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s04-00.png|I was joking .
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s05-00.png|You know I was
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s05-01.png|joking , Nigel . "
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s06-00.png|" You shouldn't joke
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s06-01.png|about serious things like engagements . "
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s07-00.png|" Don't be such a baby ! "
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s08-00.png|They were going
data/segments/p03/p03-163/p03-163-s08-01.png|to have an open quarrel

data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s00-00.png|Almost in desperation she appealed ,

data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s02-00.png|" Why ? " he
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s02-01.png|enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair .
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s03-00.png|" To bring
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s03-01.png|me up for tea , of course .
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s04-00.png|I just thought . "
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s05-00.png|" I 'll see , "
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s05-01.png|he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s05-02.png|which really hurt .
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-00.png|" Without your ring it 's just like
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-01.png|kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly ,
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-02.png|and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-03.png|receive a sharp slap for his pains .
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-00.png|" If I were somebody else's girl that 's
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-01.png|what you 'd get , " she flashed at him , and
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-02.png|so had left him , on her dignity and not
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-03.png|seeing the look of admiration and revelation
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-04.png|which had followed her slim young figure
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-05.png|out of his sight .
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-00.png|" Mine , " Nigel Lester had
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-01.png|decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-02.png|then regarded the ring which he retrieved
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-03.png|from his pocket .

data/segments/r02/r02-010/r02-010-s00-03.png|by rights should have been reserved for her tax .
data/segments/r02/r02-010/r02-010-s01-00.png|Discounting one chinchilla jacket , a Rolls-

data/segments/r02/r02-010/r02-010-s01-03.png|she now declared herself bankrupt .
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s00-00.png|The train drew into another station
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s00-01.png|and Cecil , with a further six stops
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s00-02.png|to go , was left almost alone in the
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s00-03.png|coach .
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s01-00.png|He fumed as he recol-

data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s01-05.png|solely in the office .
data/segments/r02/r02-013/r02-013-s02-00.png|' If the jacket

data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s02-00.png|She blinked
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s02-01.png|disdainfully at him and stepped out .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s03-00.png|It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s03-01.png|the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s04-00.png|He wondered what it contained .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s05-00.png|Probably the remains
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s05-01.png|of someone's lunch or a few secret files .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s06-00.png|He smiled at his own joke .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s00-00.png|It was locked .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-00.png|Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-01.png|when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-02.png|of wads of paper .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s02-00.png|' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s02-01.png|five thousand at least . '
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s03-00.png|He felt in his jacket pocket
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s03-01.png|and pulled out a key ring .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-00.png|In succession he tried
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-01.png|his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-02.png|device designed to lock typewriters .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s00-00.png|Cecil searched in his pockets once
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s00-01.png|more and came up with two
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s00-02.png|paper-clips .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-00.png|After a few seconds
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-01.png|of twisting , he roughly thrust a
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-02.png|bent wire loop into the lock and
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-03.png|waggled it around vigorously .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s02-00.png|There was a click and the
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s02-01.png|briefcase opened .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-00.png|Cecil thrust an
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-01.png|eager hand inside , his fingers
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-02.png|groping after wads of five
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-03.png|pound notes .
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s00-00.png|They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s00-01.png|nervous excitement , he pulled it out .
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s01-00.png|His eye
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s01-01.png|rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s01-02.png|side .
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s02-00.png|' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s02-01.png|tried to recall if they were still legal tender .
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s03-00.png|Surely the
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s03-01.png|Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s03-02.png|break their promise to pay on rude demand , let
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s03-03.png|alone on polite request .
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s00-00.png|Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s00-01.png|printing to find no Govr. , no Compa. , in fact no five pound notes
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s00-02.png|at all .
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s01-00.png|He was holding a paper booklet , the top sheet of which
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s01-01.png|bore , in large Baskerville type , the words METROPOLITAN

data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s02-00.png|He ruffled the sheets irritably and
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s02-01.png|glowered at his own breach of social morality .
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s00-00.png|He climbed the stairs , eager to unload the
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s00-01.png|guilt-symbol upon the ticket-collector and then
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s00-02.png|to emerge carrying his shame unseen , but burning ,
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s00-03.png|into the night .
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s01-00.png|He reached the barrier and
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s01-01.png|fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s01-02.png|briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
data/segments/r02/r02-078/r02-078-s01-03.png|intention of playing the dutiful citizen

data/segments/r02/r02-081/r02-081-s01-01.png|stretched out a hand .

data/segments/r02/r02-081/r02-081-s06-00.png|The collector pressed the twinkling

data/segments/r02/r02-081/r02-081-s07-01.png|both briefcase and conscience , stumbled away
data/segments/r02/r02-081/r02-081-s07-02.png|into the darkness .
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s00-00.png|' HELLO , CECIL .
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s01-00.png|HAD a busy day ? '
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s02-00.png|His mother came into
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s02-01.png|the hall as he opened the front door .
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s03-00.png|He nodded irritably
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s03-01.png|and , turning his back to her , contrived to slide the brief-

data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s03-03.png|and the polished brass fourteen-pounder shell-case
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s03-04.png|which served respectively as coat cupboard and um-

data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s05-00.png|His mother tidied her grey hair in the hall-mirror
data/segments/r02/r02-089/r02-089-s05-01.png|they had once obtained as a free gift in exchange

data/segments/r02/r02-109/r02-109-s00-00.png|Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the

data/segments/r02/r02-117/r02-117-s00-00.png|Cecil stepped towards the dining room .

data/segments/r02/r02-127/r02-127-s00-00.png|Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
data/segments/r02/r02-127/r02-127-s00-01.png|of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
data/segments/r02/r02-127/r02-127-s00-02.png|who is nearly bald is no longer a baby .
data/segments/r02/r02-127/r02-127-s01-00.png|He started to

data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s01-00.png|There was
data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s01-01.png|a tinkle and a thud from beside the coat cupboard .

data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s02-01.png|mother turned around in time to see the briefcase collapse

data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s03-00.png|' Well now ! '
data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s04-00.png|She hurried
data/segments/r02/r02-131/r02-131-s04-01.png|towards it and picked it up .
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s00-00.png|' What have we here ?
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s01-00.png|A new briefcase !

data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s03-00.png|Cecil halted in
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s03-01.png|mid-step near the top of the stairs and
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s03-02.png|clenched his fists .
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s04-00.png|' So that 's what
data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s04-01.png|What 's all about ? ' he hissed without

data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s05-00.png|She pointed to the

data/segments/r02/r02-137/r02-137-s07-00.png|You thought that I 'd think

data/segments/r03/r03-026/r03-026-s00-02.png|started several decades before had caught on
data/segments/r03/r03-026/r03-026-s00-03.png|at last and therefore saved the situation for
data/segments/r03/r03-026/r03-026-s00-04.png|the affluent middle-class , who now had plenty

data/segments/r06/r06-018/r06-018-s01-01.png|first night's sleeping was like a long convalescence .
data/segments/r06/r06-018/r06-018-s02-00.png|We were woken up twice about dawn by a soft
data/segments/r06/r06-018/r06-018-s02-01.png|eruption of turtle-doves .
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s00-00.png|This was strange , even magic , because the owner's
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s00-01.png|name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s00-02.png|' turtledove ' .

data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s02-00.png|When we woke up properly it
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s02-01.png|was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s02-02.png|looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s02-03.png|curling white breath of the mountains .
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s03-00.png|The land looked
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s03-01.png|like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s03-02.png|shame .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s00-00.png|There they were , in fact , below us , eight of them .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s01-00.png|Four of them were flattened on the window sills , two
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s01-01.png|immolated on a nearby roof top , the other pair copulating .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s02-00.png|We had a morning at Pierre's .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s03-00.png|He talked about people .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s04-00.png|Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s04-01.png|Lawrence .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s05-00.png|He was here , near the railway station , three or
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s05-01.png|four years .
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s06-00.png|During this period he wrote a book ,
data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s06-01.png|The Lover of Lady Chatterly .
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s00-00.png|No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s00-01.png|reading .
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s01-00.png|Lawrence died in this very place .
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s02-00.png|He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s02-01.png|again .
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s03-00.png|No , he couldn't really remember
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s03-01.png|him , he was one of the crowd .
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s04-00.png|The
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s04-01.png|sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
data/segments/r06/r06-035/r06-035-s04-02.png|sat in the square reading the Patriote .
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-00.png|There was a front-page rear-attack on de
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-01.png|Gaulle , and the rest of the paper was given up
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-02.png|to murders , apart for an outcry against a
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-03.png|proposal to drop radio-active material into
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-04.png|the Mediterranean between Corsica and St

data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s01-00.png|All the murders were well documented
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s01-01.png|and had the air of being written by an
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s01-02.png|ingenious , but mad film director of the
data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s01-03.png|Thirties .
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s00-00.png|They mostly occurred in lonely farm-houses .
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s01-00.png|Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s01-01.png|throttled to death by his wife , children and
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s01-02.png|father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s01-03.png|while the worse for drink .
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s02-00.png|The family
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s02-01.png|group then sat down for a late lunch
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s02-02.png|before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s03-00.png|Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s03-01.png|troubles , had written to the local
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s03-02.png|paper and the superintendent of police ,
data/segments/r06/r06-044/r06-044-s03-03.png|informing them that he was on the point
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s00-00.png|Monsieur V's house was immediately
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s00-01.png|surrounded by firemen and other officials ,
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s00-02.png|but there was no Monsieur V.
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s01-00.png|He telephoned
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s01-01.png|a few minutes later from a nearby village ,
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s01-02.png|apologising for the trouble , but explaining
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s01-03.png|that the walls were porous and the
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s01-04.png|gas had escaped .
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s02-00.png|General relief was
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s02-01.png|expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s02-02.png|actually reported in the next issue ) returned
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s02-03.png|home and shot himself , leaving a note
data/segments/r06/r06-049/r06-049-s02-04.png|which again left his household goods
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s00-00.png|Some grim comic relief was provided by
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s00-01.png|an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s00-02.png|who hid himself in a bush and imitated
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s00-03.png|a blackbird .
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s01-00.png|Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s01-01.png|was after this very bird and shot the farm-
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s01-02.png|labourer in the face .
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-00.png|All , however ,
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-01.png|ended well , reported the paper , since the
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-02.png|pellets were easily removed and the
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-03.png|labourer was able to return to work the
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-04.png|same afternoon .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s00-00.png|We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s01-00.png|You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s01-01.png|way .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-00.png|In the middle of the journey is a
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-01.png|valley with a sea of vines and olives
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-02.png|and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-03.png|the hoe .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-00.png|Rising from the flecked sea are
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-01.png|islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-02.png|towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-03.png|like limpets to the rock .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s00-00.png|There is a curd of morning smoke and
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s00-01.png|a muffled bell taps the sky .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-00.png|Here we
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-01.png|stopped , as in fine weather we always
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-02.png|stopped .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-00.png|Down below is the village of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-01.png|Cagnes , but between are pockets of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-02.png|heat and cold like the hands of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-03.png|friends or strangers , and a flurry of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-04.png|early smells , the dark bosoms of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-05.png|beech and the thin pine fingers
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-06.png|kissed by the sun .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-00.png|Then here was Nice , and the old holiday
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-01.png|sea , blue as a new school exercise
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-02.png|book .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-00.png|The same old Nice , creamy ,
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-01.png|vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-02.png|the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-03.png|prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-04.png|to the old sleeping port .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-00.png|This , and
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-01.png|Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-02.png|could catch the taste of dead dreams on
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-03.png|my tongue like spray .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-00.png|We parked the Lambretta opposite the
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-01.png|Negresco , and went to the beach to
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-02.png|have a swim .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s01-00.png|Amazing bedlam rocked
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s01-01.png|in our eyes .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-00.png|The sea boiled with waves ,
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-01.png|they galloped to the walls and spumed
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-02.png|over the Promenade des Anglais .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s03-00.png|A huge
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s03-01.png|crowd had collected .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-00.png|There were firemen
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-01.png|and policemen and ambulances , and the
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-02.png|eyes of the spectators were hard with
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-03.png|disaster .
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-00.png|They all had that neat look of
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-01.png|Mediterranean people to whom nothing
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-02.png|could ever happen , the chosen sane , the
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-03.png|uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-04.png|disease and accident by doctors , God and
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-05.png|the municipality .
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-00.png|Yet , at any time now ,
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-01.png|the bell would ring for them - the gilded
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-02.png|love house , the mad grandmother or the
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-03.png|bloody child at the crossroads .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s00-00.png|It was growing cold .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s01-00.png|We left the
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s01-01.png|crowd and drove back to Vence .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s02-00.png|The cool evening perfumes stood
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s02-01.png|beckoning at the corners of the roads .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-00.png|Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-01.png|organs were impaired years ago ) , and
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-02.png|I had to explain the low , sharp and
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-03.png|sweet signals in the air .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s04-00.png|When we
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s04-01.png|got back home we felt exhausted .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s05-00.png|London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s05-01.png|mingled with the memory of sandwiches
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-00.png|We went straight to bed and slept until
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-01.png|the turtle-doves drummed up the
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-02.png|sun .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-00.png|The next morning , in the square
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-01.png|opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-02.png|beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s02-00.png|Mart had been right , the body had been
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s02-01.png|a woman's .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s03-00.png|It belonged to a Madame
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s03-01.png|N.
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-00.png|Enquiries had been made in the
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-01.png|neighbourhood , and it transpired that
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-02.png|Madame N's husband had made an
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-03.png|arrangement with the dead lady's sister
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-00.png|The sister , able to swim , had returned
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-01.png|to the shore , but instead of returning
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-02.png|to her brother-in-law ( with whom
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-03.png|she had an illicit relationship ) , she
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-04.png|went to her fiance*?2's house and
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-05.png|confessed everything .
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-00.png|Her fiance*?2
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-01.png|reported her to the police , and then jumped
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-02.png|off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-00.png|The day I promised to take Catherine

data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-02.png|at his school in the country , we were
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-03.png|to leave at eleven , but she arrived
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-04.png|at nine .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s01-00.png|Her blue dress was new ,
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s01-01.png|and so were her fashionable shoes .

data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s02-01.png|hair had just been done .

data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s03-01.png|more than ever like a pink and gold

data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s00-02.png|of the river .
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-00.png|She helped me clean up my
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-01.png|flat with a devotion which said that
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-02.png|she felt small flats were altogether more
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-03.png|romantic than large houses .
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-00.png|We drank
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-01.png|tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-02.png|being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-03.png|thing from food to music .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-00.png|Catherine looked at the books lying
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-01.png|around his room , and asked if she
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-02.png|might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-03.png|to read on the train .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s01-00.png|Catherine is 13 .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s02-00.png|I suggested she might find them dif-
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s02-01.png|ficult , but she said ,
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s03-00.png|' Philip reads them ,
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s03-01.png|doesn't he ? '
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-00.png|During the journey I read
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-01.png|newspapers and watched her pretty
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-02.png|frowning face as she turned the
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-03.png|pages of Babel , for she was determined
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-04.png|to let nothing get between her and
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-00.png|At the school , which is charming , ci-
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-01.png|vilised and expensive , the two children
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-02.png|walked together across green fields , and
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-03.png|I followed , seeing how the sun gilded
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-04.png|their bright friendly heads turned
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-05.png|towards each other as they talked .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-00.png|In
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-01.png|Catherine's left hand she carried the
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-02.png|stories of Isaac Babel .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s02-00.png|After lunch we
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s02-01.png|went to the pictures .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-00.png|Philip allowed
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-01.png|# it to be seen that he thought going to
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-02.png|the pictures just for the fun of it was
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-00.png|For his sake we chose the more
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-01.png|serious of the two films that were
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-02.png|showing in the little town .
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-00.png|It was
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-01.png|about a good priest who helped cri-
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-02.png|minals in New York .
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-00.png|His goodness , how-
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-01.png|ever , was not enough to prevent one
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-02.png|of them from being sent to the gas
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-03.png|chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-04.png|Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-05.png|crying and could face the light of a golden
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-06.png|evening .
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-00.png|At the entrance of the cinema the
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-01.png|doorman was lying in wait for anyone
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-02.png|who had red eyes .
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s01-00.png|Grasping Catherine
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s01-01.png|by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s02-00.png|' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s02-01.png|punished for his crime , didn't he ? '
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s03-00.png|Cathe-
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s03-01.png|rine stared at him , incredulous .
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s04-00.png|Philip
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s04-01.png|rescued her by saying with disdain :
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s05-00.png|' Some people don't know right from wrong
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s05-01.png|even when its demonstrated to them . '
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-00.png|The doorman turned his attention
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-01.png|to the next red-eyed emerger from the
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-02.png|dark ; and we went on together to
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-03.png|the station , the children silent because
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-04.png|of the cruelty of the world .
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s01-00.png|Finally Catherine
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s01-01.png|said , her eyes wet again :
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s02-00.png|' I think its all
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s02-01.png|absolutely beastly , and I can't bear to think
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s02-02.png|about it . '
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s03-00.png|And Philip said :
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s04-00.png|' But we 've got
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s04-01.png|to think about it , don't you see , because
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s04-02.png|if we don't it 'll just go on and on , don't
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s04-03.png|you see ? '
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s00-00.png|In the train going back to London I sat
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s00-01.png|beside # Catherine .
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s01-00.png|She had the stories open
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s01-01.png|in front of her , but she said :
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s02-00.png|' Philip 's awfully lucky .
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s03-00.png|I wish I went to that school .
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s04-00.png|Did you notice
data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s04-01.png|that girl who said hullo to him in the garden
